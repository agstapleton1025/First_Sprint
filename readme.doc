Sprint Review:
 
a. 	What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
We learned the importance of communication throughout sprints. It’s hard to have meetings longer than our scrum meetings to brainstorm ideas together, so a lot of this had to be done either over text or over the phone/FaceTime. 

b. 	What did go well? Why?
We did a really good job of keeping each other in the loop on what we had been working on and what we needed help with. We also found it useful to divide and conquer on what we are all individually more skilled at, and this made the work more even for all 4 of the group members. 

c. 	What didn’t go well? Why not?
It was difficult to remember things we learned in previous classes, so it took lots of brain power and research to remember how things worked, 

d. 	How can you make things better next time?
We will make sure not to overdo the sprint and not put too much on our plate. We want to make sure we aren’t rushing through anything and are making enough progress but not working on too much too early. 

e. 	Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
We are very satisfied with the results of our first sprint! We got lots accomplished  and are excited for what our site will look like and what we have planned for the next sprint. 

f.  	Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
We did an external review with group 10. Our whole group was present for the meeting. It was very interesting and helpful to meet with them and get an outside perspective. Their project is focused on creating a business website whereas ours is for an organization's internal use to filter data. Their site had many different features present with welcoming color and style. They also had many interactive buttons and tabs incorporated already. They are moving along very well for their first sprint and we are excited to see how their progress grows!

Sprint Review

a. 	What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
Styling needed to be updated, should add mroe features than the client requests even if they say they just need the bare minimum, important not to leave out the basics.
b. 	What did go well? Why?
Styling, needed lots of improvement from last sprint and we all were able to update from comments on last time.
c. 	What didn’t go well? Why not?
Github errors, kept us from actually posting our code for a long time since the repo wasn't appearing for a few of us for awhile.
Firebase - had lots of errors during set up for connection and collaborating on the authentication pieces.
d. 	How can you make things better next time?
Early on planning and delegation of responsbilities, making sure we tackle problem areas early on in the sprint in case of bugs/errors.
e. 	Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
Yes, definitely have more back end work to complete, but on good track.
f.  	Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
